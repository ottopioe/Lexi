# Lexi
Voice recognition program


Run the .exe file within the folder.

After pressing 'Start' say "Lexi" into your default microphone and it should respond through audio output.
> If it doesn't for some reason, then check your default input and output.
> Check internet connection
> Maybe too much background noise
> Maybe you said it too soon

If it does respond, you can follow up by saying "Help" for all the features available at the current time. Those will be displayed in the app.
